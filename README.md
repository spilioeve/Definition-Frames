# Definition Frames

 In this repo we include the code for our paper Definition Frames: Using Definitions for Hybrid Concept Representations [1], which shall appear in COLING 2020. 
 
 We introduce Definition Frames (DF), a matrix distributed representation extracted from definitions, where each dimension is semantically interpretable. DF dimensions correspond to the Qualia structure relations (Boguraev and Postojovsky, 1990 [2] ): a set of relations that uniquely define a term. Our results show that DFs have competitive performance with other distributional semantic approaches on word similarity tasks.
